Today, we celebrate one year of UAB Medicine and St. Vincent's coming together. One year in, and we're proud of the care, collaboration, and dedication our teams have brought to every patient, every day. 

Together, we look forward to a bright future of continuing to provide comprehensive health care to all those we serve. hashtag#BetterTogether
